These are the commands for the holding list.

.hl show - to show the list
.hl hide - to hide it
.hl add <point> <callsign> - add a plane to the list
.hl add <point> ASEL - add a plane to the list
.hl del <callsign> - to remove a plane from the list
.hl del <ASEL> - to remove a plane from the list
.hl wait <mins> <callsign> - to add a countdown timer for the plane in the list
.hl wait <mins> ASEL - to add a countdown timer for the plane in the list

If you enter the text HOLD to the scratch pad while the aircraft has a direct to
point entered then the plane is moved to the holding list as holding over the point.

If you clear the scratch pad the plane is removed from the list.

Make sure you have the plugin loaded in Euroscope. This can be found by going to
OTHER SET > PLUG-INS in the list you should see HOLDING LIST. If not load the .dll
which can be found in the route directory of Euroscope (Main Folder).

If you done it right and loaded Euroscope you should see a holding list on your main scope.
